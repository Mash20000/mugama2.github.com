  <p>The Soup Kitchen program attracted the attention of the Nyeri County Government who offered an NHIF non-contributory status to beneficiaries with effect from February 2021. Ordinarily, each would be required to contribute Ksh 500 per month.
    This was a great motivating factor for us because it helps to allay fears and concerns about affording medical care thus allowing the space and focus on preventative care.

  <p class="fw-bold text-center text-primary">WATER PROVISION</p>
  <p>Access to clean running water was proving difficult and some of the reasons were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It emerged that some beneficiaries had settled on public land.</li>
    <li>That networks of the disconnected flow of water included other members of the public who were not listed as Soup Kitchen beneficiaries.</li>
    <li>Since water stopped flowing through some affected pipes so much time has lapsed that the underground piping system had become so damaged that complete or partial replacement was totally unavoidable.</li>
    <li>That due to significant arrears, some beneficiaries were unable to commit to much reduced payment schemes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Through the intervention of some trustees every beneficiary now has water in his/her compound. The effect of this was even further reaching than we had envisaged as we later received messages of appreciation from people who wer not Soup Kitchen beneficiaries but benefited from the reconnection and resumption of water supply. It is our hope that with more donors, the Soup Kitchen can take on more vulnerable and needy people in the Magutu community.</p>
